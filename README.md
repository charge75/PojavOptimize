# PojavOptimize

A collection of mods to improve the performance and user experience of PojavLauncher. This repository was originally assembled by Discord moderator Chuck_Norris_ as a response to low performance on certain devices, as well as goodies in other areas. This modpack requires **Fabric 1.16.5** to be installed on the client machine!

**NOTE:** As of right now, the auto updater isn't yet ready. Our plans to make a GitHub Action that runs every hour were derailed when we learned that Curseforge does not have an easily accessible API or ability to use `wget` on their downloads page. Our plan is to gather the source code for these mods and hopefully run a build every time there's a new version, but we have to work out how exactly that's going to work.
